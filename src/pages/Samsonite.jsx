                            <p>When Jesse Shwayder founded Samsonite in 1910, he aimed to create suitcases of exceptional quality and craftsmanship that could withstand all travel risks. He sought a name that represented strength and durability for his products. He chose one of his favorite biblical heroes, Samson, known for his extraordinary strength, to represent these core values.
                                It can be said that the history of Samsonite's development is closely tied to the history of travel because: In 1910, travel was very rudimentary and only accessible to a few who wanted to explore the world. The first suitcases were entirely handmade, primarily based on the principle of durability and the ability to endure strong impacts from long journeys for a small, wealthy clientele. </p>
